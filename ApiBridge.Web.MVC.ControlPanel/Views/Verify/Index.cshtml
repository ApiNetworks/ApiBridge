                                prohibits interfering with the advertisements they add to your web pages. If you

                                may delete your account for violating its TOS.</p>

                            <p>
                                The most reliable way is to configure the server to send out a redirection instruction
                                when the old URL is requested. Then the browser will automatically get the new URL.
                                This is the fastest and most efficient way, and is the only way described here that
                                can convince indexing robots to phase out the old URL. For configuration details
                                consult your server admin or documentation (with NCSA or Apache servers, use a Redirect
                                statement in .htaccess).</p>
                            <p>
                                If you can't set up a redirect, there are other possibilities. These are inferior
                                because they tell the search engines that there's still a page at the old location,
                                not that the page has moved to a new location. But if it's impossible for you to
                                configure redirection at your server, here are two alternatives:</p>

                                Password protection is done through HTTP authentication. The configuration details
                                vary from server to server, so you should read the authentication section of your
                                server documentation. Contact your server administrator if you need help with this.</p>

                                JavaScript password scripts provide only a facade of security. At a fundamental
                                level, they work in one of two ways. Some scripts convert the password into a URL,
                                which keeps the document secret by limiting the number of people who know its URL.
                                Some scripts check the password and then go to a specific URL, which protects the
                                document only from those who don't view the JavaScript source to get the URL of
                                the document. Neither mechanism is really secure.</p>

                            <p>
                                Browsers cache web documents; they store local copies of documents to speed up repeated
                                references to documents that haven't changed. Also, many browsers are configured
                                to use public proxy caches, which serve many users (e.g., all customers of an ISP,
                                or all employees behind a corporate firewall). To effectively control how your documents
                                are cached you must configure your server to send appropriate HTTP headers.</p>
                            <p>
                                The Expires header is understood by virtually all caches. The cached document will
                                be retrieved again automatically once it has expired. The Expires header must contain
                                an HTTP date, which must be Greenwich Mean Time (GMT), not local time.</p>

                                These scripts annoy visitors who lose ready access to their browsers' normal context-menu
                                functions (e.g., "Open in new window" or "Bookmark link"). These scripts can also
                                interfere with features like mouse gestures. Nothing (including these scripts) can
                                prevent anyone from copying your source or images. The browser cannot display your
                                document without the source and images, so your web server must send them to the
                                browser. Even without the various "save" functions in today's browsers, someone
                                can retrieve your source or images from the browser's cache, request them from the
                                server with some other tool, or use a screen-capture tool to copy the images. These
                                scripts do nothing when JavaScript is disabled or unavailable, when JavaScript access
                                to right-click events is disabled, on systems without mice, or on systems with single-button

                                You can't. URLs are fundamental to navigation on the WWW. The URL is necessary for
                                the browser to be able to retrieve your document. It is impossible to hide the URL

                                Many browsers identify themselves when they request a document. A CGI script will
                                have this information available in the HTTP_USER_AGENT environment variable, and
                                it can use that to send out a version of the document which is optimized for that
                                browser.</p>
                            <p>
                                Keep in mind not all browsers identify themselves correctly. For example, Microsoft
                                Internet Explorer identifies itself as Netscape Navigator, and many other browsers
                                identify themselves as Microsoft Internet Explorer.</p>
                            <p>
                                And of course, if a cache proxy keeps a version intended for one brower, someone
                                with another browser may get that version, rather than the version intended for
                                the other browser.</p>

                                You can't. Although each request for a document is usually logged with the name
                                or address of the remote host, the actual username is almost never logged as well.
                                This is mostly because of performance reasons, as it would require that the server
                                uses the ident protocol to see who is on the other end. This takes time. And if
                                a cache proxy is doing the request, you don't get anything sensible.</p>

                                a nightmare as well as an invasion of privacy!</p>

                                If only Internet Explorer ignores your custom 404 Not Found messages, then you've
                                been caught by its "friendly" HTTP error messages. When a special HTTP response
                                (e.g., a 404 Not Found response) is shorter than 512 bytes, Internet Explorer substitutes
                                its own message for the one delivered by the server. As a user of Internet Explorer,
                                you can disable this feature in the "Advanced" options panel. As a web author, your
